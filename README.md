# Secret-Santa

This little python program asks for the number of participants, then for their names.
Then the names are mixed up and each person is paired with another - there is a logic that will ensure that
no person is paired with him/herself. The results are printed in separate files.
The filenames are the players' name and the file contains a little christmas tree and the person
that he/she is matched with, the one he/she should surprise at christmas.

It is up to the users not to sneak peek into other's file which would reveal the secret santa ;)
